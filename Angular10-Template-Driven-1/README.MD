About this project:
I have developed this sample web application using below technologies:

Angular 10.0.5
Node: 12.18.3
NPM 6.13.1

This project has Frontend which I developed using Angular 10.0.5 also this project has a backend service which I developed using Node: 12.18.3. Angular Frontend calls the NodeJs backend service.


Angular(10) has multiple ways of developing webapps which include Template Driven Way,  Reactive Forms Way etc.
I have developed this webapp using Template Driven Way. 
Later I will add separate sample Angular apps using Control/Validity State, Reactive Forms, Routs etc. 

I have used intuitive naming for classes and variables so its easy to understand the code.

To run this app please follow:

1. Download and install NodeJS
2. Install Angular from terminal command prompt:

   npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
   
3. Download this project.

4. Open new command terminal. 

5. In new Terminal go to commodities-service directory of this project where you downloaded it and run:

   npm i

6. Then start the backend commodities-service using:

   npm start
   
   The backend service runs on port 3000 (make sure its not used by any other app.) 

7. Open new command terminal.

8. In new Terminal  go to commodities-exchange directory of this project where you downloaded it and run:

   npm i

10. Then start the Angular frontend webapp by running below on command prompt:
